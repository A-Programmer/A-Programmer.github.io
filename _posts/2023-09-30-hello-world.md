## Introduction

I am Kamran Sadin, a Software Engineer .

Finally, I decided to use Github Pages and Jekyll to run my blog.

In this blog, I am going to share my knowledge as a Software Engineer, my main purpose is to share C# Developer Roadmap content but I will also create other content.

For the C# Developer roadmap, you can follow [#100DaysOfCSharp](https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/all/?keywords=%23100DaysOfCSharp&origin=GLOBAL_SEARCH_HEADER&sid=S%2C1) on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/MrSadin) or the `CSharp` category on my blog.

## Goals and process flow

I am following C# 10 in a Nutshell as a baseline to provide a good C# learning path. In this journey I am not just mentioning some topics, Also I try to create comprehensive content for each topic with real project examples in very simple words.

For this, I read the C# 10 in a Nutshell, research to add more information using Google, ask ChatGPT to add more information if I missed something, create real project examples, try to explain it in simple words and create slides to visualize the topic important parts.

## Train your yourself

A person who sacrifices himself for others could not do such a thing from the beginning, he started with small sacrifices. Similarly, the person who steals millions of dollars was not a thief from the beginning, he started by stealing chocolate.

I shared a summary about small habits once, taken from the Small Habits book, small habits guide you to victory (or falling, if you choose the wrong goal). If you want to wake up at 4 AM and you are waking up at 10 AM, you can not change yourself suddenly, you need to change it in days, months, even years, like starting to wake up at 9:30 for some weeks, then 9 AM, and so on.
I always request you to smile, right? Do you know why? Because I want you to be happy but know that you can not change yourself instantly! you are not a robot, you need time, you need to be trained, and you need to start from somewhere, right? The first step is a simple smile on your face, then you need to count the good points of your life, like having a partner, having a family, and health.

If you plan to be a Senior C#/.NET Developer, you can not be in a month! Really you need time, Maybe a topic is just 2-3 pages to read, and reading it will take 30 minutes top, but you need to understand the topic, you need to use it in a project to practice, and you need to read other guys view on this topic, so it is going to take time to finish that topic.

but the point is, you need to start somewhere, and here you can start, just follow my [Linkedin](https://linkedin.com/in/MrSadin) posts with [#100DaysOfCSharp](https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/all/?keywords=%23100DaysOfCSharp&origin=GLOBAL_SEARCH_HEADER&sid=S%2C1) or read my posts on this blog under `CSharp` category.
